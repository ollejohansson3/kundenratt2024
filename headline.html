        <h2>Metaverse Is Still A Massive Flop</h2>
        <div class="container" align="left">

                <h4>I mean we all kind of saw it coming right? Is anyone still even playing this? Everyone knows about Meta's not so new disaster of a project, but how did it come to be this way? What were the reasons nobody wanted to play this absolute dumpster-fire of a game?</h4>
                
                It all started with a bold vision: a sprawling, pixelated utopia where you could attend meetings as a floating legless torso and buy virtual Gucci sneakers with real-world cash. The promise of the metaverse was tantalizing—a place where you could escape the drudgery of reality to enter... well, a worse-rendered version of reality with server lag. Unfortunately, it turns out people don’t want to sit in virtual conference rooms when real-life conference rooms are bad enough. Who knew?
                <br><br>
                At the height of metaverse hype, NFTs were touted as digital Mona Lisas—except these Mona Lisas were pixelated apes wearing sunglasses. The idea was simple: spend your hard-earned money on digital assets that might one day make you rich in an entirely speculative economy. Sadly, owning a JPEG of a sad monkey didn't grant users the social clout or financial independence they were promised. In the end, NFTs were the Beanie Babies of the digital age, except even your grandma didn’t fall for it.
                <br><br>
                
                <img src="img/markcropped.jpg" alt="marc sugarberg" align=left hspace="15" width="250" height="250"> One of the most glaring design oversights of the metaverse was the lack of legs. Somehow, billions of dollars were invested, but no one could figure out how to make avatars fully bipedal. Users complained about their floating torsos while developers assured them that legs were "coming soon." By the time Meta unveiled avatars with legs, no one was left to care. Turns out, legless avatars are fine when no one’s logging in.
                <br><br>
                
                At one point, virtual real estate was the hottest commodity since Dutch tulip bulbs. Speculators paid millions for plots of land in Decentraland and Sandbox, convinced that digital neighborhoods would rival Beverly Hills. Fast forward to today, and those properties are about as valuable as Geocities pages. Entire "cities" in the metaverse became ghost towns, proving once and for all that even in virtual reality, location matters.
                <br><br>
                
                When big brands like Walmart and Taco Bell set up shop in the metaverse, it felt like the future had arrived. Who wouldn’t want to browse a virtual Taco Bell or buy a pair of VR Crocs? But as it turned out, even in the digital world, people didn't want to hang out in a glorified mall. Companies slowly backed away, leaving behind their digital storefronts like relics of a forgotten civilization.
                <br><br>
                
                <img src="img/vrcropped.webp" alt="goofy vr" align=right hspace="15" width="250" height="250">Ironically, the most successful "metaverse" turned out to be Fortnite, a free-to-play battle royale game where people could dance, attend concerts, and shoot each other with ridiculous weapons—all without buying virtual land or NFTs. The simplicity of Fortnite made Meta's grand vision look like overcomplicated, overpriced nonsense. By the time the metaverse tried to catch up, it was too late. Nobody wanted to trade their banana suit for a virtual office cubicle.
                <br><br>
                
                The rise and fall of the metaverse has taught us one valuable lesson: just because you can make something virtual doesn’t mean you should. Perhaps people enjoy the tangible comforts of the real world—like actual legs and real tacos. Who could have guessed? Well, literally everyone except Silicon Valley.
